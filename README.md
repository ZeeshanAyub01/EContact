# EContact

This is a simple program to store contact information to a database, written in C#. As of right now, the GUI has been completed. The next step is to add a database connection and
we have decided to use PostgreSQL for that instead of MS SQL server. Further on, we'll add a network capability to add transmit contact information over a network, and later on we
might add webb pages.

The program has no functionality currently, but feel free to look at the tentative design of the GUI posted as a .png file in the main directory.
